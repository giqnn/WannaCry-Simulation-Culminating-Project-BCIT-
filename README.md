# Culminating Project

In the modern era, cybersecurity has become crucial for organizations and individuals. This is due to societyâ€™s dependency on various industrial control systems that help our world function. These include the workstations in business operations to the PLCs in plant operations. Therefore, we must implement security in these systems to allow continuous operation in our world. Our project consists of detailing the effects of ransomware on an industrial organization, specifically using the WannaCry malware.

This project represents the culmination of our two years of study in INCS. This project will be completed for INCS 4810 as a showcase of our skills. In this project, we will show off skills that we have gained from classes such as advanced networking and ethical hacking. This project will consist of three main parts:
Creation of Network
Vulnerability Testing and Scanning
Security Implementation
